        "OVERALL SUMMARY\n",
        "1. The HMM was implemented to model phoneme transitions for the word “speech”.\n",
        "2. Four hidden states were used: /s/, /p/, /iː/, /tʃ/.\n",
        "3. Observations were acoustic features: Energy, Pitch, Duration.\n",
        "4. Initial probability was fixed so the model always starts at /s/.\n",
        "5. Transition probabilities were stored in a matrix representing phoneme-to-phoneme movement.\n",
        "6. Emission probabilities were used to determine which acoustic feature each phoneme emits.\n",
        "7. Python dictionaries were used to represent all probabilities neatly.\n",
        "8. A function was written to display initial, transition, and emission matrices clearly.\n",
        "9. A sequence generator function produced:\n",
        "a phoneme sequence corresponding acoustic observations\n",
        "10. A transition matrix heatmap was plotted for visualization.\n",
        "11. The generated sequence typically followed the expected pattern: /s/ → /p/ → /iː/ → /tʃ/.\n",
        "12. Observations matched the emission probability distribution of each phoneme.\n",
        "13. The HMM successfully demonstrated how sequential speech patterns can be modeled mathematically.\n",
        "14. The experiment proved that HMMs are effective for simulating phoneme transitions and acoustic outputs."
